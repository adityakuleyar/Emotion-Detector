# Emotion-Detector
It's a facial expression detector(Emotion detector).
I have used Python, opencv and tensorflow in it.
It is based on a live feed system where when you run the code the camera opens and it records the facial expression.
I am not uploading my data set, you can create your own or download it from internet.
